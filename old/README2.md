# An-Hour-of-Python

Steve Jobs once said “Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think”.

I fully agree with this, programming is just not a way to solve problems or get things done. As you progress to gain more knowledge, you will see how your coding skills can affect the ways you think. After all, if you know a problem well enough to describe it to a computer, you probably know it better than most.

Python i a general programming language, the world's most popular programming language in 2019 and its popularity has only increased since. Python is especially popular in the fields of datascience and bioinformatics, two fields that should be of interest to a student of biology.

Python is known to have a simple compact syntax and easily readable code since it contains few special characters, such as semicolons. Compare the two programs below, the first one in C++, another popular coding language and then the same program in Python.

### C++

```C++
// This C++ program prints Hello, World!
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World! \n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Python

```python
# This Python program prints Hello, World!
print("Hello, World! \n")
```


Because of its simplicity, Python is suitable for beginners and for people who do not code every day (like me). It is suitable both for scripts for automation of some repetitive task but also for complex software with graphical interfaces.

One of the most important advantages of Python is the large size of its community, since this means that you can often find questions and answers to your coding problems by a simply searching with google.


Python is used from everything between bioinformatics to data science and stock
trading.


Python is a general programming language and the Python community is huge so
python is used for everything from


- creating graphical user interfaces
- stock and cryptocurrency trading
- Population dynamics
- Reading data from a commerical data logger
- Controling the height of a standing desk

We will spend one hour learning the basics of Python using simple examples
relevant to biology/bioinformatics. The tutor will demonstrate the basic data
types and repetition and decision making in the logical flow of a program.

Python will be used to search sequence data on Genbank using pydna and
formalize a simple cloning procedure.

These exercises are aimed at complete beginners with no previous programming experience.

It gives an overview of the language with an emphasis on practical problem- solving, using examples and exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics when possible.

Thhis class is structured so that the parts of the language that are more useful for bioinformatics are introduced as early as possible, and that students could write real programs after the first few sessions. After completing the workshop, students should be able to (1) apply the skills they have learned to tackling problems in their own research and (2) continue study Python on their own.
