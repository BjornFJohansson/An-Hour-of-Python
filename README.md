# An-Hour-of-Python

Steve Jobs once [said](https://youtu.be/IY7EsTnUSxY?t=2)

“Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think”.

I fully agree with this, programming is not just a way to solve problems or get things done, but it can be so much more.

As you progress to gain more knowledge, you will see how your coding skills can affect the ways you think. After all, if you know a problem well enough to describe it to a computer, you probably know it better than most. This [TED talk](https://youtu.be/xfBWk4nw440?t=24) (10 min) sums up the argument in a nice way. The speaker has a website [here](https://christian.gen.co/you-should-learn-to-program).

Python i a general programming language, the world's most popular programming language in 2019 and its popularity has [only increased since](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html). Python is especially popular in the fields of [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) and [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics), two fields that should be of interest to a student of biology.

Python is known to have a simple compact syntax and easily readable code since it contains few special characters, such as semicolons.

Compare the two programs below, the first one in C++, another popular coding language and then the same program in Python.

### C++

```C++
// This C++ program prints Hello, World!
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World! \n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Python

```python
# This Python program prints Hello, World!
print("Hello, World! \n")
```

Because of its simplicity, Python is suitable for beginners and for people who do not code every day (like me). It is suitable both for scripts for automation of some repetitive task but also for complex software with graphical interfaces.

One of the most important advantages of Python is the large size of its community, since this means that you can often find questions and answers to your coding problems by a simply searching with google.

Python is used for everything from

- Graphical User Interface ([gui](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/seguid_calculator)) for sequence checksums.
- Stock and cryptocurrency trading ([video](https://youtu.be/GdlFhF6gjKo)).
- Quantitative Economics
- Population dynamics ([blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-population-models-in-python-57f9e174d27d))
- Reading data from a commercial temperature data logger ([package](https://github.com/civic/elitech-datareader)).
- Controlling the height of a standing desk [code](https://pypi.org/project/idasen) [video](https://youtu.be/LEXQOhEzVhE?t=404).


You can even make games using Python:

We will spend one hour learning the basics of Python using simple examples. The exercises are aimed at complete beginners with no previous programming experience.

The tutor will demonstrate the basic data
types and repetition and decision making in the logical flow of a program.We will use the [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org) integrated development environment (IDE). At the end we will code some simple examples relevant to biology/bioinformatics.

Python will be used to search sequence data on Genbank using pydna and
formalize a simple cloning procedure.

### Exercises

The Spyder editor was installed with the Anaconda distribution that you should have installed before this class ([See instructions here](ddd)).

Start Spyder from the start menu of your computer.

![spyder](pics/spyder.png)

Spyder has two important parts, the text editor to the left and the interactive console to the right at the bottom.

Download and save the file "spyder_session.py".

Open it in Spyder, it shoul look as the picture above.



### Where to go from here ?

As any new language that you might try to learn, you will lose your new knowledge if you do not practise. The challenge is to find something in your daily life, however small, where you can apply programming to save time or improve quality.

[Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research)
"This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python. While there are many excellent introductory Python courses available, most typically do not go deep enough for you to apply your Python skills to research projects. In this course, after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn about tools commonly used in research settings. This version of the course includes a new module on statistical learning."

The course consists of few hundreds of programming assignments for Python, ranging from basics up to complex topics. Right now Stepik.org is developing an adaptive learning engine which chooses content for each learner individually – by his/her level and knowledge gaps. In this course you can try out the first prototype of this engine.
