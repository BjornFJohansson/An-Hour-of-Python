# An-Hour-of-Python



Steve Jobs once said “Everybody in this country should learn to program a
computer, because it teaches you how to think”. Python became the world's most
popular programming language in 2019 and its popularity has only increased since.

Python is used from everything between bioinformatics to data science and stock
trading.

We will spend one hour learning the basics of Python using simple examples
relevant to biology/bioinformatics. The tutor will demonstrate the basic data
types and repetition and decision making in the logical flow of a program.

Python will be used to search sequence data on Genbank using pydna and
formalize a simple cloning procedure.

Python is a readable language with a simple compact syntax and has become a popular tool for all types of bioinformatics work.

Why should you learn how to program? Watch this TED talk.

Python is suitable for beginners and for people who do not code every day. It is suitable both for scripts for automation of some repetitive task but also for complex software with graphical interfaces.

These exercises are aimed at complete beginners with no previous programming experience.

It gives an overview of the language with an emphasis on practical problem- solving, using examples and exercises drawn from various aspects of bioinformatics when possible.

Thhis class is structured so that the parts of the language that are more useful for bioinformatics are introduced as early as possible, and that students could write real programs after the first few sessions. After completing the workshop, students should be able to (1) apply the skills they have learned to tackling problems in their own research and (2) continue study Python on their own.
